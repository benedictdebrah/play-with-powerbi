I recently started learning  Power BI after being a tableau user for a while, and it's been really interesting seeing how many concepts carry over.
To get my hands dirty, I decided to tackle some projects, starting simple and gradually trying out more complex stuff. 

below are some of the dashboards i did

### Sales dashboard
